Multi-Disease Prediction using boosting models.

Heart disease, Diabetes and Obesity are among the top five fatal diseases that affect lives worldwide. Therefore, its early prediction and detection are crucial, allowing one to take proper and necessary measures at earlier stages. Machine learning (ML) techniques like Boosting models are used to assist healthcare providers in better diagnosing heart disease. Now a days most of this diseases are occurring because of the habits means lifestyle parameters. Here we used data set contain lifestyle parameters.

This model is build after fullfilling of pre-required process like handling missing data, balancing the labels, removing out layers.

For all data sets used same techniques for model making and used comparitive analysis.
